# FLD (FromListDownloader)
Hello, this is my another python program! It allows you to download files from links you put in the list(list.txt)
Supported formats: png, jpg, mp4, webm
# How to use
1. Unzip the file, of course
2. Do a right-click on start.bat, then click Edit, and change Your_Direction_To_Python.exe to the path of python.exe
3. Put your links into list.txt(remember about the supported formats!)
4. Launch the program via the batch file and use it 
P.S. Python Installer often installs it to Your_Home_Partition:/Users/User_Name/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/PythonXX(your_version)/
